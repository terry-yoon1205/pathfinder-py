# Check-in 1
Our group has decided to work on an analysis tool for Python.
Current ideas:
- method runtime analysis
- convert loops into list comprehensions
- method call analysis
- type checking for non-statically typed languages (eg. Python)

Our main plan for the time being is just brainstorming ideas for the project, and deciding on an option by late this week/early next week
